/section Mechanical Design

/subsection Overview
I worked on the mechanical design and system integration of the PLATO Hand, a proprioceptive three-finger robotic hand that uses rigid fingernails for precise force control and contact sensing.  
The goal was to make a hand that could handle both delicate and dynamic interactions using proprioception instead of relying on bulky sensors or soft fingertips.  
Most of my time went into making the hardware compact, reliable, and easy to work with while keeping the system responsive enough for real manipulation tasks.

/subsection Key Design
Each finger uses a five-bar linkage that mimics how human fingers bend, giving the hand eight total degrees of freedom.  
I designed everything in CAD, fit the actuators and sensors, and refined the geometry until it could actually be built and assembled without fighting tolerances or cable clearances.  
The challenge was finding space for everything while keeping the hand light and backdrivable.

Design details:
/bullet
MCP joint: direct-driven with a QDD actuator (GIM3505, 0.43 Nm continuous torque).  
PIP joint: driven through a linkage that increases torque when the finger bends.  
Fingernails: machined aluminum tips mounted on miniature 6-axis FT sensors, coated with a thin silicone layer for protection and grip.

I also reworked several internal structures to make sensors easier to access during calibration and to keep wiring neat and serviceable.

/subsection Fingernail System
The fingertip design combines a rigid nail surface with a soft layer underneath, similar to how a real fingernail interacts with objects.  
By mounting the nail directly onto the FT sensor, the hand gets a stiff contact surface that transmits force signals cleanly without losing tactile feedback.  
The silicone coating protects the sensor during impacts while still letting the system pick up small force variations.

In practice, this setup allowed the hand to handle thin or flat objects like coins and cards, absorb repeated impacts without damage, and maintain better control than fully soft designs.


/section Experimentation and Testing

/subsection Setup
Once the hardware was assembled, I worked on testing both the physical prototype and the simulated version in Isaac Sim.  
The experiments focused on how well the hand could manipulate different objects, how accurately it could estimate contact forces, and how durable the mechanical parts were under extended use.

We ran several types of tests:
/bullet
Thin-object handling: lifting and stacking coins and cards using fingernail contact.  
Dynamic manipulation: catching and flicking lightweight objects under teleoperation.  
Force estimation: comparing torque-based force estimates with FT sensor readings.  
Durability: impact and long-term fatigue testing on the finger assemblies.
/endbullet

I set up the test rigs, defined safety limits for high-speed operation, and handled the data collection and analysis for each run.  
Most of these experiments helped us identify how design changes actually affected performance in the real system.


/section Control and Teleoperation Software

/subsection Overview
Alongside the mechanical work, I developed the control and teleoperation software that we used for experiments.  
This made it easier to run tests, visualize data, and fine-tune the system without constantly rewriting scripts or restarting the robot.  
The goal was to make operating the hand as intuitive and repeatable as possible.

Main features:
/bullet
Saved joint positions for repeatable trials.  
Minimum-jerk motion planning for smooth movement.  
Live logging of joint angles and contact forces.  
Visualization and control through Foxglove Studio.
/endbullet

This setup turned testing into a faster feedback loop - I could make a mechanical change, update a control parameter, and see the result immediately in both motion and data.


/section Results and Impact

/subsection Performance
The final hand performed well across a range of tests:
/bullet
Total weight: 1.3 kg  
Payload capacity: 11.3 kg  
Fingertip force up to 20 N  
Less than 10 percent error between estimated and measured forces  
Stable proprioceptive control during hybrid rigid-compliant grasps
/endbullet

/subsection Outcome
The PLATO Hand showed that rigid fingertips and proprioceptive control can work together to achieve precise, responsive manipulation.  
I designed and built the hardware, helped run the experiments, and wrote the software that made it all usable.  
This project led to two research papers and became the foundation for the labâ€™s next generation of proprioceptive hands.


/section Design Challenges and Lessons Learned

/bullet
Fitting actuators, sensors, and wiring into a compact hand while keeping it backdrivable took multiple iterations.  
Cable routing and sensor mounting caused signal noise early on, which I fixed with better internal fixtures and strain relief.  
Finding the right silicone thickness for the fingernails was a balance between protecting the sensors and keeping contact sharp.  
I also learned how much easier research becomes when hardware is designed for calibration, quick assembly, and long-term maintenance.
