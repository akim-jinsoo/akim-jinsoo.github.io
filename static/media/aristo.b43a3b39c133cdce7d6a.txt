/section Overview
The ARISTO (Anthropomorphic, Robotic, Integrated-Sensing, TendOn-driven) Hand is the next generation of the PLATO platform, designed to explore how multimodal sensing can improve dexterous robotic manipulation.

While PLATO focused on human-like mechanics and proprioceptive control, ARISTO expands this concept by integrating tactile, force, and visual feedback into a single system. The hand features capacitive tactile sensors embedded in the fingertips, six-axis force-torque sensors at the fingernails, and RGB-D cameras for visual feedback. Together, these sensing modalities replicate how humans use touch and vision to plan, grasp, and manipulate complex objects.

/section Objective
The goal of ARISTO is to study how integrated sensing and learning-based control can enable more adaptive and human-like manipulation. By fusing data from touch, force, and vision, the system aims to improve contact understanding, grasp stability, and autonomous skill acquisition through machine learning.

/section Status
This project is currently under active development. Hardware design, sensor integration, and initial data collection are in progress.
Please check back later for updates as the first prototype and experimental results become available.
