/subsection Role
Engineering Intern – Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Department

/subsection Overview
During my internship at Samsung Austin Semiconductor (SAS), I worked within the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Department on multiple process improvement and automation projects.  
My work focused on increasing operational efficiency, reducing downtime, and improving documentation protocols across the department.

/subsection Autonomous Fluid Mixer Development
I collaborated with another intern and two senior engineers to design and build an autonomous fluid mixer.  
The system used Arduino-based control and 3D-printed components to automate chemical mixing processes previously performed manually.  
This automation improved consistency and reduced technician time during setup.

/subsection Cost Analysis
I conducted a detailed cost analysis of the CVD process, including component usage, chemical consumption, and recipe modifications for wafers.  
The resulting report identified several inefficiencies, leading to process optimizations that saved the company over $2 million annually.

/subsection Response Protocol Enhancement
I reviewed and updated all shutdown response protocols for CVD tools to improve maintenance and safety reliability.  
In addition to revising existing procedures, I authored over 20 new tool-specific protocols tailored for my CVD team’s equipment.  
I also initiated collaboration with five other CVD teams to develop and standardize additional documentation, significantly reducing downtime and improving wafer throughput.

/subsection Summary
My internship at SAS provided hands-on experience in process engineering, cost analysis, automation, and technical documentation.  
The projects I led and contributed to improved both efficiency and reliability within the CVD department, generating measurable cost savings and operational improvements.
