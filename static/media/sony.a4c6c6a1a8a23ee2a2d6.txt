/subsection Objective
During my internship at Sony, I worked on the PLATO Project — a collaboration between Sony and UT Austin to develop a teleoperated robotic system capable of precise manipulation and haptic feedback.  
My focus was improving the PLATO Hand V1, which suffered from limited torque and an overly complex electrical system.  
The goal was to redesign and validate a new version — PLATO Hand V1.5 — that met Sony’s standards for reliability, strength, and maintainability.

/subsection Challenges
The PLATO Hand V1 faced two major issues: limited actuation torque and excessive wiring complexity.  
The HT2205 motors were rated for 0.04 Nm, but in testing, only produced around 0.03 Nm — barely enough to lift a Jenga block, which required 0.031 Nm.  
Additionally, the hand’s electrical system used 81 wires and relied on hot glue for mounting, making it fragile and nearly impossible to service.  
The project goal was to increase torque while reducing wiring and improving accessibility.

/subsection Actuator Test Bed
We have decided to use harmonic drive as our gearbox. Why harmonic drive?

The department I was working with has previous experience using the harmonic drive, which would allow technical support from the mechanical engineers there.
The internship was on a tight timeline, so an off-the-shelf product was necessary to complete the goals
0 backlash, which is critical for fine & precise manipulation
Maintaining back-driveability of the motors is a crucial point of the hand that improves safety when playing with other human players.

While harmonic drives are susceptible to damage when experiencing sudden impact or force, however, our use case doesn't include that, so it should be fine under normal operation.
I addtionally developed a test bed with a force gauge to verify and validate the actuator prototype, which includes the housing, motor, and gearbox.

/subsection Mechanical Redesign
To solve the torque limitation, I integrated 30:1 harmonic drives into the MCP joints, boosting torque from 0.03 Nm to roughly 0.9 Nm.
This upgrade enabled strong, controlled grasping without sacrificing backdrivability — essential for safe teleoperation.  
For the PIP joints, where space was limited, I modified the pulley ratio from 1:1 to 1.49:1, increasing torque to 0.045 Nm without redesigning the housing.

/subsection Electrical System Redesign
I reworked the entire electrical system to eliminate wiring clutter and improve maintainability.  
Each finger received its own compact PCB containing:

SimpleFOCMini V1.0 motor controllers (3x)  
ESP32 Devkit V1.0 microcontroller (1x)  
TJA1050 CAN transceiver (1x)
/endbullet

This modular layout replaced 81 individual wires with clean CAN communication and localized control.  
I also designed a new mounting system that secured each PCB mechanically, removing hot glue and making maintenance far faster and safer.

/subsection Final Assembly
After completing the redesign, the PLATO Hand V1.5 was assembled and tested successfully.  
The torque improvements made fine manipulation tasks — including grasping and moving Jenga blocks — stable and consistent.  
The simplified electrical system improved reliability, made servicing straightforward, and enabled future modular upgrades.  
The result was a far more robust, serviceable robotic hand that set the foundation for Sony’s ongoing PLATO research.
