/section ME 392Q – Hockey Bot

/subsection Project Objective
In the Advanced Mechatronics I (ME 392Q) course, my team was tasked with creating an autonomous hockey shooting robot.  
The challenge involved detecting three possible goals, each emitting a unique IR signal, and shooting a puck into the correct target.  
Our team of five collaborated to design, prototype, and build a functional system capable of autonomous operation.

/subsection First Prototype
I began by building a rapid prototype using LEGO components and a small motor to test the flywheel concept for shooting.  
This initial version confirmed the mechanical feasibility of using a flywheel-based shooter.

/subsection Second Prototype
Based on insights from the first iteration, I designed an improved mechanical shooter and puck loader using 3D printing and laser-cut plywood.  
The design emphasized simplicity, cost efficiency, and modularity for quick testing.  
I also handled the electrical system, wiring, and motor control.  
We used two L298N H-Bridge drivers controlled via an Arduino and Raspberry Pi combination, with code written in both the Arduino IDE and Python.  
My main focus was motor synchronization, encoder feedback, and control stability.

/subsection Final Robot
Through testing, we identified structural weaknesses in the chassis and motor mounts, as well as control instability with the mecanum wheels.  
We transitioned to a tank drive configuration for greater stability and replaced the chassis with laser-cut acrylic for higher rigidity.  
These changes significantly improved mobility and overall robustness.

/subsection Summary
The Hockey Bot project strengthened my understanding of mechatronic integration—combining mechanical design, electronics, and embedded software.  
It also emphasized rapid prototyping, iterative improvement, and practical problem solving under hardware constraints.
