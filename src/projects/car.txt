/section ME 338 – RC Car

/subsection Project Overview
As part of the Advanced Mechatronics (ME 338) course, I worked on a team tasked with designing and building a high-performance RC car for a circuit race.  
Our main goals were to develop a modular, reliable, and lightweight design while maintaining mechanical simplicity and robustness.

/subsection Chassis Design
I was responsible for designing the chassis structure.  
We adopted a modular frame with cap fittings for easy battery replacement and maintenance.  
The initial design used ABS, but due to limited availability, we switched to PLA and reduced the chassis thickness from 6.35 mm to 5.3 mm to compensate for material differences.  
I conducted stress, displacement, and strain analyses in SolidWorks to validate the structure’s ability to handle loads from the drivetrain and impacts during operation.

/subsection Steering Mechanism
The main challenge in steering was maintaining stability within a small chassis footprint while keeping the system modular.  
I designed a wide 220 mm front axle to improve traction and cornering control.  
We implemented a single-axle steering design that balanced simplicity and precision, using PLA for rapid iteration and durability under collision stress.

/subsection Powertrain Development
I designed a custom gear case using a compact triangular gear layout to maximize space efficiency.  
The open gearbox design allowed easy maintenance and quick gear replacement during testing.  
We used rigid white resin for the gears to handle high rotational speeds and a carbon fiber rod for the rear axle to maintain stiffness with minimal weight.

/subsection Aesthetic and Functional Add-ons
Inspired by Formula 1 design, I modeled a 3D-printed aerodynamic body kit, including front and rear wings, side skirts, and chassis panels.  
These components improved both the car’s aesthetics and aerodynamic stability.  
The front wing doubled as a protective guard for the steering mechanism during collisions.

/subsection Post-Race Analysis
While the RC car performed well during testing and races, we identified issues with tire grip and drivetrain endurance.  
Future improvements could include weighted front axles for better traction and metal gears for enhanced wear resistance.

/subsection Summary
The RC Car project reinforced my understanding of mechanical design optimization, drivetrain integration, and performance tuning under real-world constraints.  
It also demonstrated the impact of iterative prototyping and material selection on reliability and competitive performance.
