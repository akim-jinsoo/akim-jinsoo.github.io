/section Mouse Haptic

/subsection Objective
At the HeRo Lab, I led the development of an autonomous mouse tester designed to aid pharmaceutical research on dynamic allodyniaâ€”a condition where light touch causes pain.  
The goal was to automate behavioral testing for mice, improving consistency, efficiency, and throughput in neurological pain research.

/subsection Initial Design
Building on the concept of a one-channel mouse sorter, the initial prototype featured a dual-environment design.  
A brush applied light strokes at random intervals on the dark side of the chamber, while IR sensors tracked mouse movements between light and dark zones.  
Since mice prefer darkness, those experiencing pain would retreat toward the light side, allowing behavioral data collection.  
While conceptually effective, the design proved too complex and difficult to manufacture reliably.

/subsection Design Improvement Efforts
To simplify construction, we developed a five-channel prototype using acrylic sheets for the wire mesh, which were compatible with laser cutting.  
However, this version was material-inefficient and cumbersome, prompting a redesign focused on modularity and assembly efficiency.

/subsection Current Prototype
The latest version replaced acrylic sheets with aluminum extrusions, resulting in a lighter and more robust structure.  
We expanded the system to six channels to increase testing capacity and integrated a 12V motor with a CPR encoder and IR sensors for precise control of brush motion.  
The device runs on an Arduino Mega for control logic and automation.  
A patent application was filed, but due to limited slots, it was not initially accepted. A reapplication is in progress.

/subsection On-Hold Status
Despite positive technical results, the project was placed on temporary hold due to shifting research priorities and limited lab resources.

/subsection Summary
The Mouse Haptic project represented a step toward automating tactile sensitivity research, combining mechanical design, embedded systems, and behavioral testing into a scalable biomedical research tool.
