/section Mouse Haptic

/subsection Objective
At the HeRo Lab, I led the development of an autonomous mouse tester designed to support pharmaceutical research on dynamic allodynia â€” a condition where light touch causes pain.  
The goal was to automate behavioral testing for mice, improving consistency, efficiency, and throughput in neurological pain studies.

/subsection Initial Design
The first prototype was based on a one-channel mouse sorter and used a dual-environment chamber.  
A brush applied light strokes at random intervals on the dark side while IR sensors tracked mouse movement between light and dark zones.  
Since mice prefer darkness, those experiencing pain would retreat toward the light, providing a measurable behavioral signal.  
The setup worked conceptually but was too complex and difficult to manufacture consistently.

/subsection Design Improvement Efforts
To simplify manufacturing, we developed a five-channel prototype using acrylic sheets for the wire mesh, chosen for laser-cut compatibility.  
Although this improved precision and repeatability, the design was inefficient in material use and assembly time.  
We shifted focus toward a modular, easier-to-assemble design that could scale testing capacity without sacrificing accuracy.

/subsection Current Prototype
The latest prototype replaced acrylic with aluminum extrusions, making the structure lighter, stronger, and easier to maintain.  
We expanded the design to six independent testing channels and integrated a 12V motor with a CPR encoder and IR sensors for precise brush motion control.  
The system runs on an Arduino Mega for full automation and data collection.  
A provisional patent application was filed to protect the design, but the process was paused when the project lost funding and was indefinitely halted.

/subsection Project Status
Despite strong technical progress and promising test results, the project ultimately lost funding and has been halted indefinitely.  
The final prototype remains functional and documented, ready to continue development if future resources become available.

/subsection Summary
The Mouse Haptic project combined mechanical design, embedded systems, and behavioral research into an automated platform for studying pain sensitivity in mice.
