 /section Project Title
 /subsection Overview
 A short overview of the project (one or two sentences).

 /subsection Motivation
 Why you built this project and what problem it solves.

 /subsection Implementation
 Use `/list` ... `/endlist` for ordered lists and `/bullet` ... `/endbullet` for unordered lists.

 /list
 Hardware: Custom board and actuators
		 Sensors: Tactile pads
		 Actuation: Tendon-driven fingers
 Control: Real-time impedance controller
 /endlist

 /bullet
 Key features
		 Low-latency sensing
		 Robust grasping
 /endbullet

 (Nesting: indent list lines with a tab or two spaces to create sub-levels.)

 /subsection Results
 Summary of results and any quantitative metrics.

 /subsection Media examples
 Images and videos can be embedded with the following directives.

 Image syntax examples:
 - Basic image (no alt text in directive):
   /image /aristo.png

 - With options (key=value options separated by commas):
   /image /aristo.png aspect=16:9, height=240, crop=top

   Options:
   - `aspect=WxH` (e.g. `16:9` or `4/3`) — enforce aspect ratio.
   - `height=NN` (px) (e.g. `height=240` or `height=240px`) — maximum container height in pixels (used as maxHeight when aspect is specified).
   - `crop=position` — `center`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` or any CSS `object-position` value.

 Video syntax example:
 - /video /demo/video.mp4 Demonstration of the grasping pipeline

 # Notes for authors
 - Use `/section` and `/subsection` to create headings.
 - Plain lines become paragraphs.
 - Ordered sections: put `/list` then place each item on its own line; indent with a tab or two spaces for nested entries.
 - Unordered sections: same as above but use `/bullet` and `/endbullet`.
 - Images support optional aspect/height/crop parameters as shown above.
 - Videos accept a URL and an optional caption.

 Happy authoring!
