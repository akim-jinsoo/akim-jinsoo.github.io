/section Computer Game for Rehabilitating Kids with Neurological Injuries (FIRE)

/subsection Objective
This project was part of my Freshman Introduction to Research Engineering (FIRE) program.  
The goal was to create an affordable and engaging interactive game for children recovering from traumatic brain injuries.  
The motivation came from our mentor, Professor James Sulzer, whose daughter Livie suffered a severe head injury.  
He noted that most existing rehabilitation devices were prohibitively expensive, inspiring our team to design a low-cost, accessible alternative.

/subsection Initial Prototype
Our first prototype was a simple interactive matching game where Livie aligned on-screen prompts with a physical board.  
To minimize costs, we repurposed old keyboards and cards for the mechanical interface.  
During testing, Livie was more interested in stress-testing the prototype than playing the game, but the concept showed potential for engagement and rehabilitation.

/subsection Final Prototype
We refined the design using 3D printed and laser-cut parts to improve durability and prevent damage during use.  
The keycaps were redesigned to be visually appealing and textured for tactile feedback.  
When Livie answered correctly, the system played funny reward sounds, which kept her entertained and motivated.

/subsection Results

/subsubsection Engagement
/bullet
Livie smiled frequently and attempted to imitate the reward sounds.
She showed sustained engagement, far exceeding our expectations.

/subsubsection Interaction
/bullet
Livie kept her hands on the keys throughout gameplay.
She explored the textures and shapes of the redesigned components.

/subsection Cost and Accessibility
The total project cost was approximately $29.07, excluding 3D printing.  
Most parts were made from common household materials.  
The software was written in JavaScript and HTML, allowing future deployment on the web for free, device-independent access.

/subsection Summary
The FIRE rehabilitation game demonstrated that low-cost, home-built systems can provide meaningful therapy experiences for children with neurological injuries.  
It combined simple hardware, playful software, and accessibility-driven design into an effective rehabilitation tool.
